                    This was a project with friends based on an idea of the classmate; Similar functionality to a modern 
                    chat messenger but with one twist, the only communication method is media, memes specifically. At the 
                    core it allows you to communicate using top-trending memes on specified subreddits. This project was fun
                    to make for a lot of reasons, it also served as a nice introduction to Flask and a good refresher on
                    OAuth2 and websockets.
