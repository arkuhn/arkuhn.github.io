                    In order to best perform newly assigned iOS development at work, I decided to undergo a personal project to 
                    reduce ramp-up time and have some fun doing so. What better to do than to port an ancient windows game to iOS? 
                    The game is very simple but it provided an introduction to the iOS ecosystem. This particular project helped 
                    prepare me for production animation creation and data management in Swift down the line.
